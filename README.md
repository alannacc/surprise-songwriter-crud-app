# Surprising Songwriters

A CRUD app that lists songs with surprising songwriters! Users can add new songs to the list, 'like' the most surprising ones, and delete.

**Live Website:** https://songwriter-surprise-app.herokuapp.com/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Express, MongoDB, EJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Server-side built with Express to create an API that can connect with the MongoDB database and make GET, POST and DELETE requests. EJS is used to update the HTML fluidly as the database changes in response to user interaction. 

## Optimizations

Updating the app to include photos and links to the songs. Ideally, I'd like to change the theme & layout of the website to have the song and artist appear first with an image, and then the user be able to click to reveal the surprise songwriter. Then carousel through the different songs.

## Lessons Learned:

Utilizing the CRUD operations. This is the first app I built that had the functionality of users being about to 'like' items.
